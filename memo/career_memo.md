# Career Reflection Memo

**Name:** Jasmine Chang  
**Course:** BUS-313  
**Date:** December 12, 2025  

## Introduction
My name is Jasmine Chang, and I am a third-year student double majoring in Management Information Systems and Accounting. I was born and raised on Oʻahu and graduated from Punahou School. Outside of academics, I run a small business with my sister where we sell handmade crafts such as customizable keychains and beaded necklaces, a venture we started during Covid that has grown through local craft fairs. I also have two dogs, Soobie and Roca, who bring a lot of joy (and chaos) to my life. On campus, I serve as the Vice President of Finance for the American Marketing Association and the Director of Communications for the Information Technology Management Association. Although these roles keep me busy, they have allowed me to build meaningful relationships, develop leadership skills, and gain professional experience that has shaped my interests and career goals.

The purpose of this memo is to reflect on my career goals. As I come closer to graduation, it is important for me to take a step back and look at the big picture. When thinking about my future career, I want to have a job that I enjoy going to, one where I feel motivated, challenged, and fulfilled. I want to work in an environment that allows me to grow both personally and professionally while contributing meaningful work to my team or community. As I continue developing my skills in both MIS and Accounting, I am trying to better understand which path aligns most with my strengths, interests, and long-term aspirations. This reflection is an opportunity for me to clarify what I am looking for in my early career and identify the steps I need to take to get there.

## Career Objectives
Even though I am double majoring in Management Information Systems and Accounting, I currently have a stronger interest in pursuing a career in accounting. This past summer, I interned at a local accounting firm, KMH LLP, in their audit division. Through this experience, I gained real world exposure to working with diverse clients, auditing financial statements, and applying what I learned in class to actual engagements. It showed me how dynamic the audit field can be and how much collaboration and problem solving it requires. When I think about accounting in the long run, I see it as a stable and reliable career path with many opportunities for growth, but I still wonder whether it is the type of work I can see myself doing for the rest of my life.

This path appeals to me because I feel that I can genuinely apply myself in this field and continue growing both personally and professionally. Through my internship, I realized that I enjoy the structure and purpose behind audit work. It requires attention to detail, critical thinking, and strong communication, all skills I have been developing through my coursework and leadership roles on campus. I also like that auditing provides insight into how different businesses operate, which keeps the work interesting and helps me understand the bigger picture of financial reporting. Accounting gives me a strong foundation and a clear direction to build upon as I continue gaining experience.

In the short run, I hope to continue gaining experience in audit to build a strong foundation in financial reporting and better understand different industries. I also want to develop my technical skills such as data analytics, SQL, and Python so I can bring a more technology driven perspective to traditional accounting work. Long term, I am interested in becoming a CPA and exploring roles that combine analytics and auditing, such as data driven assurance or advisory. To achieve these goals, I know I will need relevant internship experience, strong analytical skills, and professional credentials like the CPA license.

## Action Plan
Over the next few months, one of my main goals is to continue strengthening my technical and professional foundation. I plan to build a small portfolio of projects that highlight my skills in data analytics and MIS, such as dashboards or simple web applications. I also want to begin preparing for the CPA pathway by researching exam requirements, mapping out a timeline, and talking with mentors who have already gone through the process. Updating my LinkedIn and resume to reflect my recent experiences is another step I plan to take, as this will help me present myself more confidently when applying for internships or networking with professionals.Over the next few months, one of my main goals is to continue strengthening my technical and professional foundation.

In addition to technical preparation, I want to be more intentional about networking and career exploration. I plan to attend career events hosted by Shidler, ITMA, and AMA to learn more about different industries and connect with professionals. Meeting with Career Services will also help me refine my job search strategy and better understand what roles align with my interests. By taking these steps, I hope to gain more clarity regarding my long term career direction while building the skills, relationships, and confidence needed to succeed in the accounting and MIS fields.
